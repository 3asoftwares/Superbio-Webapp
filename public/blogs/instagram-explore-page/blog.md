# How to Master the 2023 Explore Page Algorithm and Reach New Audiences!

For the Explore tab, the algorithm looks at previous posts that you’ve liked or interacted with, and pulls in a collection of photos and videos from related accounts that you don’t follow (yet!).

These photos and videos are then ranked by what you’ll be most interested in, based on how likely you are to like, save or share a post. Here’s what matters:

1. **Information about the post.**
   The algorithm evaluates the overall popularity of a post, using signals like how many people are liking, commenting, sharing and saving, and how quickly these activities happen.

2. **Your history of interacting with the person who posted.**
   Most of the content on Explore will be from new-to-you accounts, but accounts you have interacted with in the past get a bit of a boost here.

3. **Your activity.**
   What posts have you liked, commented on, or saved in the past? How have you behaved on the Explore page previously? Your activity history impacts what Instagram assumes you might be interested in seeing more of.

4. **Information about the person who posted.**
   If an account has had lots of interaction with users in the past few weeks, it’s a signal to Instagram that there’s some compelling content going on that others might like, too.

5. **Relevancy of the content.**
   Instagram’s algorithm wants to show you the most relevant content possible based on your interests, so it takes into account the content of the post and how well it matches up with what you’ve engaged with in the past.

   **Hot Tip:** To improve your chances of appearing on the Explore page, create content that is closely related to the niche or topic you’re interested in. Use hashtags and location tags to increase your visibility and reach.

6. **Diversity of content.**
   Instagram wants to show you a range of content types, from photos to videos to Stories, so it will prioritize accounts that post a variety of content.

   **Hot Tip:** Mix up your content types to keep your audience engaged and increase your chances of appearing on the Explore page. Try posting photos, videos, Reels, and Stories to keep things interesting.

7. **Timeliness of the content.**
   Instagram’s algorithm favors fresh content, so it will show you the latest posts that are most relevant to your interests.

   **Hot Tip:** Post regularly to stay top-of-mind with your followers and increase your chances of appearing on the Explore page. Use Instagram’s scheduling feature to plan out your posts in advance.

8. **Engagement with the content.**
   Instagram’s algorithm looks at how users are engaging with the content on the Explore page, so it will show you posts that are getting a lot of likes, comments, and shares.

   **Hot Tip:** To increase your chances of appearing on the Explore page, encourage your followers to engage with your content by asking questions, running contests, or using calls-to-action in your captions.

By understanding the 2023 Explore Page Algorithm and focusing on these ranking factors, you can increase your visibility and reach new audiences on Instagram. Keep experimenting with different content types and engagement strategies to find what works best for you!
