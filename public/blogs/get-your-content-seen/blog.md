# 5 Tips for Working with the Instagram Algorithm (and Getting Your Content Seen)

Okay, we’ve got all the facts: now it’s time to use them to our advantage. Here’s how to really get into the rhythm.

## 1. Respect the Community Guidelines

Whether you’re posting on the Feed, in Reels, or to Stories, Instagram’s algorithms limit the visibility of content that goes against the app’s Community Guidelines. If you’re sharing misinformation, posts that are political in nature, content that’s potentially upsetting or sensitive, or even just low-resolution media, you may find your content less widely distributed.

**Hot Tip:** If you think you’ve been shadowbanned, this is probably why!

## 2. Make Original Content

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri says that the platform values original content over reposted or reshared content—so be as creative as possible when you’re brainstorming new posts. Try using your original audio for reels, coming up with captions that are distinct and informative, and embracing unusual ideas.

Of course, no idea is born in a vacuum: the Reel above plays on traditional influencer content, but the creator has a fresh (and funny) take. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel—just look at the wheel from a new perspective.

## 3. Schedule Your Posts at the Right Time for Maximum Reach

Audience interaction is an important signal across the board on Instagram, so posting your content at the right day and time is going to make a huge difference to your organic reach. Luckily, Hootsuite’s dashboard helps crunch the numbers and offers suggested best times to post, based on your audience’s unique behavior.

## 4. Encourage Engagement

Engagement rules all on Instagram (in fact, it’s one of the most important ranking factors on all the top social media platforms). Views are great, but likes, comments, shares, and saves matter more. Consider encouraging your audience to engage with your content by asking questions, hosting giveaways, or creating ultra-shareable posts (here’s a whole blog post dedicated to increasing your engagement).

## 5. Respond to DMs and Comments

This strategy is also all about engagement: the more you engage with your audience, the more likely they’ll be to engage with you. Being responsive in your comment section and your DMs builds trust with your followers, and helps remind them that there’s real people on the other side of their screens.

**Bonus:** Notice any big dips or spikes in your stats recently? Analytics is often the first place a social media manager can tell if something has changed in the Instagram algorithm — and start adjusting their strategy accordingly.
