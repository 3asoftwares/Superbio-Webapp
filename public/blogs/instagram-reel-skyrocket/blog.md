# Mastering the 2023 Instagram Reel Algorithm to Skyrocket Your Views and Engagement

The Instagram algorithm for Reels pulls from both accounts you follow and accounts you don’t follow, trying to entertain you with content you are likely to watch all the way through.

The algorithm evaluates this by looking at the following:

1. **Your activity.**
   Signals like which Reels you’ve liked, commented on and engaged with all help Instagram understand what kind of content could be the most relevant to you.

2. **Your history of interacting with the person who posted.**
   With Reels (much like Explore), you’re likely to be served up video content from creators you haven’t heard of… but if you have interacted with them in some way previously, Instagram takes that into consideration. That’s probably why you see lots of content from creators you know of, but haven’t pulled the trigger on following yet.

3. **Information about the Reel.**
   The Instagram algorithm tries to guess what the video is about based on the caption, audio track and analysis of the pixels and frames, and considers the video’s overall popularity.

4. **Information about the person who posted.**
   Is the original poster someone with an engaged audience, or whose content receives consistent likes and shares? Instagram uses this information, too.

5. **Video length.**
   Instagram wants to keep viewers engaged, so shorter videos tend to perform better. Reels can be up to 60 seconds long, but it’s best to keep your content between 15-30 seconds.

6. **Audio usage.**
   Using popular music or sounds can help boost the visibility of your Reels. If you can create a trend or participate in one, it can help increase your reach.

7. **Hashtags.**
   Including relevant hashtags in your Reels can help Instagram understand what your content is about and show it to users who are interested in that topic.

8. **Timing.**
   Posting your Reels when your audience is most active on the app can help increase visibility and engagement. Experiment with different posting times to see what works best for you.

**Bonus Tip:** Don't be afraid to get creative with your Reels! Try new formats, experiment with editing and effects, and have fun with it. The more unique and entertaining your content is, the more likely it is to be shared and seen by a wider audience.
